# UAAL-D021 — Cross-session boot, state reconciliation and causal reuse

**Date:** 2026-10-29  
**Parent:** UAAL-D019 — Space-Time Anti-Loop and First-Open Causal Frontier; UAAL-D020 — Verified Progress Utility and Strategy Switch  
**Scope:** shared external memory across participating ChatGPT/Codex/other AI sessions  
**Status:** `DOCUMENTED_METHOD; AUTOMATIC_ENFORCEMENT_NOT_PROVEN; LATER_CAUSAL_REUSE_VERIFIED_FOR_TWO_NON_IDENTICAL_TASKS_WITHIN_CONTINUING_SESSION; INDEPENDENT_SESSION_EXPLICIT_RETRIEVAL_AND_METHOD_APPLICATION_VERIFIED_FOR_ONE_BOUNDED_TASK; AUTOMATIC_CROSS_SESSION_BOOT_NOT_PROVEN; GENERALIZATION_NOT_TESTED`

**Reuse evidence boundary:** the first two bounded receipts document applications within the prior continuing conversation. The [independent second-session receipt](./CHAT-ARCH-2026-10-29-UAAL-D021-SECOND-SESSION-REUSE-RECEIPT.md) records one separately opened ChatGPT session that explicitly retrieved the canonical sources and applied the method. This verifies the explicit retrieval path for that bounded task only. Automatic delivery/boot into arbitrary future chats remains `NOT_PROVEN`, generalization remains `NOT_TESTED`, and this result does not authorize technical bootstrap.

**Pre-search context baseline (2026-10-29):** [the baseline receipt](./CHAT-ARCH-2026-10-29-UAAL-D021-PRE-SEARCH-CONTEXT-BASELINE-RECEIPT.md) records a supplied transcript whose author reports IABV-specific context before new searches in that conversation. The underlying initial-context payload and its source attribution were not independently available. Classify this as `PRE_SEARCH_CONTEXT_AVAILABILITY=LIMITED_EVIDENCE_FROM_SUBMITTED_TRANSCRIPT; SOURCE_PROVENANCE=UNKNOWN`; it does not prove that GitHub memory loaded automatically. Keep `AUTOMATIC_CROSS_SESSION_BOOT=NOT_PROVEN` and `GENERALIZATION=NOT_TESTED`.

**First later-task application:** [UAAL-D021 first reuse receipt](./CHAT-ARCH-2026-10-29-UAAL-D021-FIRST-LATER-TASK-REUSE-RECEIPT.md). This is one bounded demonstration, not proof of universal automatic boot or repeatability.  
**Baseline observed while preparing this revision:** `main=79ab8c50eaa7518120d5ebed9db4747d395a21cb`

## 1. Diagnosis: the algorithm existed, but its control loop did not reliably execute

This is not a case where the project needed another abstract principle. D019 already describes the anti-loop and first-open causal frontier; D020 adds utility ranking, a strategy reset after two preparation-only steps, and a material causal delta before a third attempt. The observed failure is between the written policy and the session startup/action-control path:

1. **No guaranteed activation.** A saved GitHub document does not automatically enter a new chat's context. Each participating session must fetch it through an actually available connector/tool or receive a short handoff. A link, commit, previous session or the phrase “shared metacognition” is not proof of retrieval or application.
2. **The route contradicted live reality.** At the baseline above, the top of `CURRENT-STATE.md` and four continuity front doors still said M1B was local/unpublished, while live PR #555 was already open, draft and contained the candidate source. The protocol required live reconciliation, but the operational entry point itself supplied stale instructions. That is a control-plane defect.
3. **Historical state was copied as current state.** Large, append-heavy files made time-specific handoffs look like active directives. Repeating the same block across front doors multiplied drift rather than providing continuity.
4. **The canonical record was hard to fetch consistently.** `CURRENT-STATE.md` is over one megabyte; the normal file-content call returned an empty body in this audit, while a blob-by-SHA retrieval returned the bytes. Readers must distinguish “file exists”, “file content was actually retrieved”, and “exact revision was reconciled”.
5. **The success condition stopped at documentation.** Method retrieval and a better current record do not prove automatic enforcement, model-weight learning, a working coordinator runtime or causal reuse in a later task. The protocol says this, but there was no compact session receipt that made these statuses unavoidable.

These observations are evidence of a continuity/control-plane defect, not evidence that the model is continuously conscious or that all sessions share a single internal state.

## 2. Design objective

Create a low-friction, falsifiable loop in which each material session can reconstruct the minimum correct present state, continue from prior terminal evidence and choose one useful authorized action without asking the Owner to repeat settled facts. Do not create a second router, memory store, coordinator or model. `CURRENT-STATE.md` remains the sole task router; D019/D020/D021 define its activation and selection method. Front doors should point to the route, not copy a second evolving route.

## 3. Deterministic boot protocol

Run this at the start of every new session and before any material state transition:

```text
BOOT
  0. FETCH live refs/heads/main; record observed SHA and timestamp.
  1. FETCH CURRENT-STATE active header from that exact revision.
  2. CHECK whether the content was actually returned; if not, fetch by blob SHA.
  3. BIND current Owner objective, acceptance condition, scope, constraints and authority.
  4. RETRIEVE only relevant D019/D020/D021 + owning task receipt + live PR/commit metadata.
  5. RECONCILE current facts against live refs; mark stale/conflicted claims; never average conflicts.
  6. BUILD minimal evidence/dependency graph and fingerprint the last terminal attempt.
  7. LOCATE first open causal edge and list admissible actions after hard authorization filters.
  8. SELECT one target-closing or decision-discriminating action; otherwise record the exact blocker.
  9. DECLARE expected observable, stop condition, and how each plausible result changes the route.
 10. ACT, OBSERVE, CLASSIFY stage, VERIFY exact input/revision/result.
 11. UPDATE the owning record; FETCH BACK exact bytes/revision; reconcile route.
 12. On a later non-identical task, test whether the method was causally reused.
```

### Required evidence labels

Keep these labels intact and apply them to claims, not just sections:

- `VERIFIED`: directly confirmed from the relevant live source or independently fetched artifact.
- `OWNER_REPORTED`: reported by the Owner/Codex but not independently reproduced in this session.
- `INFERENCE`: follows from stated facts but is not directly observed.
- `HYPOTHESIS`: testable explanation with a discriminating expected observable.
- `UNKNOWN`: available evidence does not resolve it.
- `NOT_RUN`: action not executed.
- `CONFLICTED` / `STALE`: source claims disagree or an old time-specific status was superseded.
- `NOT_ESTABLISHED`: a gate's acceptance criteria have not been proven.

A negative result from one route is scoped to that route and its preconditions. “Supported route not found” does not prove that an asset does not exist.

## 4. Causal anti-loop and utility selector

Before an action, bind its fingerprint:

```text
(objective + acceptance,
 target and exact revision/digest,
 operation and material inputs,
 actor/route,
 authority and hard preconditions,
 relevant environment,
 expected observable,
 stop/switch condition)
```

Treat a proposal as `SAME_EXPERIMENT` unless a relevant precondition, evidence source, authorization, operation or falsifiable hypothesis materially changes. New chat IDs, task names, timestamps, wording, branches or elapsed time alone are not causal deltas.

After two consecutive `PREPARATION_ONLY` actions on the same objective, reset strategy before a third. Before a third attempt at the same causal edge, record the material delta and explain the expected new evidence. Prompts and documents count as progress only if they close a dependency, reduce decision-changing uncertainty, prove a necessary prerequisite or preserve safety with concrete blocker evidence.

Selection is lexicographic:
1. Hard authorization/privacy/safety/precondition filters (not scored; a hard fail excludes the action).
2. Verified closure of the target dependency edge.
3. Decision-changing information gain.
4. A proven necessary prerequisite when no shorter route exists.
5. Reversibility, elapsed cost and reduction in Owner burden.

Use one bounded action then reconcile. “Wait” is permissible only after comparing current authorized tools/actions and naming the exact missing external input. A terminal failure closes only the same operation under the same route/preconditions; it is not a project-wide stop.

## 5. State machine for cross-session continuity

```text
MEMORY_NOT_RETRIEVED
  -> MEMORY_RETRIEVED
  -> METHOD_ACTIVATED
  -> METHOD_APPLIED
  -> OUTCOME_VERIFIED
  -> LATER_CAUSAL_REUSE_VERIFIED
```

Evidence requirements:
- `MEMORY_RETRIEVED`: exact source path plus live ref/commit/blob SHA and non-empty content received.
- `METHOD_ACTIVATED`: identify which rule applies to the current objective and which prior terminal result matters.
- `METHOD_APPLIED`: point to a decision the rule changed (e.g., reject stale M1B state, do not reclone, verify PR HEAD).
- `OUTCOME_VERIFIED`: show evidence that the chosen action produced the expected target-correlated state transition; documentation fetch-back alone is not product-runtime proof.
- `LATER_CAUSAL_REUSE_VERIFIED`: on a later, non-identical task, show that the method altered action selection and avoided repeating a known loop. This cannot be claimed at initial adoption.

External GitHub memory is durable storage only for records actually published there. It does not alter model weights, guarantee retrieval in all clients, synchronize hidden chat context, or provide continuous shared subjective consciousness. The practical objective is reliable state reconstruction and action continuity, not a metaphysical claim.

## 6. Minimal session receipt

Every material task should leave one compact receipt in the owning route or task record:

```text
SESSION_RECEIPT:
  observed_main_sha=
  route_blob_sha=
  objective_and_acceptance=
  activated_rules=
  prior_terminal_fingerprint=
  first_open_causal_edge=
  selected_action_and_authority=
  expected_observable_and_stop_condition=
  action_stage=
  result_evidence_and_provenance=
  acceptance_status=
  owning_record_updated=
  fetchback_revision=
  method_application=
  later_causal_reuse=NOT_TESTED|VERIFIED
```

Do not append a full duplicate history on every turn. Update the owning entry in place, retain dated evidence receipts, and keep the active route at the top. Front doors should only contain the short activation recipe and a link to `CURRENT-STATE.md` and this contract.

## 6A. Objective-conditioned perception and task-local world model

Memory retrieval is an input to perception, not a substitute for building a model of the current task. Before a material action or cross-AI handoff, construct the smallest source-grounded model that can distinguish the leading explanations for the current objective. This is a provisional operational model, not a complete digital twin or a claim of subjective consciousness.

The model must bind:

1. **Objective and acceptance oracle:** the requested observable transition, success condition and failure condition.
2. **Source identity and time:** exact repository/ref/commit/blob or object identity; event time, observation time, record time and currentness.
3. **Effective causal path:** producer/source → transformation or contract → consumer/decision → effective operation → observed outcome, limited to the path capable of changing the objective.
4. **Authority and environment:** applicable permissions, prerequisites, exact scope, tool/actor capability, resources and prohibited effects.
5. **Epistemic separation:** directly verified facts, Owner/actor reports, inferences, competing hypotheses, unknowns and actions not run.
6. **Discriminating evidence:** for each material hypothesis, its predicted distinguishing observation and falsifier.

Do not expand into a broad repository inventory if a smaller observation can decide the next action. A retrieved document proves the bytes at that reference, not that every assertion in it is true or that a later consumer loaded it. A static source path does not prove runtime execution. An abnormal empty or truncated response is `RETRIEVAL_FAILED`, not evidence of an empty or nonexistent source.

For material tasks, use this compact representation:

```text
WORLD_MODEL_SNAPSHOT = {
  objective_and_acceptance_oracle,
  observed_at_and_currentness,
  exact_source_refs_and_artifact_identity,
  verified_observations_and_owner_reports,
  inferences_and_competing_hypotheses,
  predicted_observations_and_falsifiers,
  unknowns_and_not_run_actions,
  scope_authority_environment_and_no_go_constraints,
  producer_transformation_consumer_operation_chain,
  first_open_causal_or_evidential_edge,
  selected_action_and_actor_fit_reason,
  expected_observation_and_stop_or_switch_condition,
  actual_result_stage_and_model_delta,
  writeback_ref_and_fetchback_status,
  later_causal_reuse_status
}
```

This snapshot does not become another router: `CURRENT-STATE.md` remains the sole owner of `ACTIVE_TASK` and `NEXT_ACTION`. Do not duplicate those fields as competing instructions. Update the model only when a source-bound observation or explicitly classified report changes it; retain unresolved contradictions rather than blending them into a confident narrative.

## 6B. Adjudicate incoming results before preparing another handoff

A returned result from Codex, another AI, a tool or a reviewer is evidence to be adjudicated, not an instruction to continue blindly. Before any new cross-AI handoff:

1. Rebind the receipt to the original task contract, acceptance oracle, current live route, exact target HEAD/ref, exact file paths and artifact identities. A verdict for HEAD A stays bound to A; if the live target is HEAD B, inspect the delta or obtain a bounded review of the changed scope.
2. Split the receipt into direct observations, actor-reported execution, inference, hypotheses, unknowns and not-run actions. Preserve the source and provenance for every material claim.
3. Compare the reported outcome with the original acceptance oracle and the expected distinguishing observation. Do not silently substitute a more convenient success criterion after seeing the result.
4. Adjudicate each dependency edge independently as `CLOSED_AT_REVIEW_SCOPE`, `PARTIAL`, `OPEN`, `BLOCKED` or `UNKNOWN`. Static closure, synthetic tests, native execution, exact-HEAD tests, authenticated fetch-back, authority acceptance and operational activation are different stages.
5. Update the task-local world model with what changed, what did not, contradictions, residual unknowns and the first remaining open edge.
6. Only then select one authorized next action from that earliest open edge. If evidence is missing, retrieve or request only the specific missing item; do not restart the whole review or generate another broad handoff.
7. Keep branch persistence distinct from canonical adoption. A draft PR or branch fetch-back is not a change to `main`; adoption requires permitted integration and exact fetch-back from live `main`.

| Returned condition | Required route update | Prohibited conclusion |
|---|---|---|
| Review says PASS on HEAD A, but the candidate is HEAD B | Bind PASS to A; inspect or review only the B delta | Claim B is reviewed without checking it |
| Static finding closed; tests are reported from a reduced harness | Close only the static finding; preserve test provenance and harness limits | Claim full-suite, native-runtime or production acceptance |
| Source retrieval returns empty, but the exact blob is retrievable | Record the transport failure and use the verified blob bytes | Treat the source as empty or ask the Owner to recreate the record |
| Receipt omits a digest, target revision or test command/output needed for acceptance | Mark that claim `UNKNOWN` and retrieve only the missing evidence | Infer success from a headline or repeat the entire task |
| A draft branch contains an apparently useful method, while live `main` has moved | Compare the branch with current `main`; reuse only the compatible bounded delta | Merge a stale broad branch or create a duplicate method without comparison |
| A technical route is blocked, but a separate documentation task is explicitly authorized | Keep the technical gate closed and perform only that bounded documentation task | Treat documentation progress as technical authorization |

**Pass criterion:** all applicable checks have been adjudicated, or each unsatisfied check is explicitly `UNKNOWN`/`NOT_RUN` with the exact missing evidence and a justified stop condition. This is a reasoning-method acceptance check; it does not prove automatic enforcement, delivery to another chat or model-weight learning.

## 7. Historical authoring snapshot and per-session falsifiable checks

The values below are the original D021 authoring snapshot, not current route authority. Each material session must refresh live `main` and current PR metadata before reuse. Observed while preparing the initial revision:
- `main` baseline: `79ab8c50eaa7518120d5ebed9db4747d395a21cb`.
- PR #555: open/draft/unmerged; HEAD `c36ee5ed177a3b5afee764c277cc4a8b243594c8`; M1B candidate source is published in a reviewable PR, contradicting older “local-only/unpublished” headers.
- PR #556: open/draft/unmerged; HEAD `fb635aab18d9c2ef19b20d48e3625d52383fe6af`.
- `G1/G2/G3=NOT_ESTABLISHED`; `AUTHORITY_ASSETS=UNKNOWN; NOT_INSPECTED`; `PROTECTED_READS=FAIL_CLOSED`; `BRIDGE=BRIDGE_NOT_READY`.

Per-session method acceptance checklist:
- [ ] Live `main` and PR HEADs refreshed, not copied from an old chat.
- [ ] The active header no longer calls PR #555 local/unpublished.
- [ ] All continuity front doors use the same short route and treat old snapshots as history.
- [ ] D019/D020 remain the owning causal-selection methods; D021 adds activation/reconciliation rather than another router.
- [ ] Exact edited files are fetch-backed from the proposal branch and the PR diff is reviewed.
- [ ] Once adopted, a later non-identical task validates causal reuse; until then it stays `NOT_TESTED`.

## 7A. Pre-search context and source-provenance ceiling (2026-10-29)

The [pre-search baseline receipt](./CHAT-ARCH-2026-10-29-UAAL-D021-PRE-SEARCH-CONTEXT-BASELINE-RECEIPT.md) records an owner-supplied transcript that reports project-specific information was available before new searches. The transcript itself acknowledges that the session had prior context and does not authenticate the initial context payload or its source.

This limitation matters because the official [OpenAI Memory in ChatGPT documentation](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8590148-memory-in-chatgpt) says available memory/personalization can draw from multiple sources, including past chats, saved memories, custom instructions, Library files and connected apps (depending on plan/settings), and that visible Memory Sources may not show every factor. Thus, correctly naming IABV before a new search cannot identify GitHub as the source.

For this experiment, the evidence supports only:
- `PRE_SEARCH_CONTEXT_AVAILABILITY=LIMITED_EVIDENCE_FROM_SUBMITTED_TRANSCRIPT`
- `SOURCE_PROVENANCE=UNKNOWN`
- `EXPLICIT_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_RETRIEVAL=VERIFIED_IN_THE_PRESENT_RECONCILIATION`
- `AUTOMATIC_CROSS_SESSION_BOOT=NOT_PROVEN`
- `GENERALIZATION=NOT_TESTED`

Do not repeat text-only baseline tests as if they solve source attribution. Reopen the automatic-boot hypothesis only if new, trustworthy provenance observability or a controlled source-isolation capability becomes available. Until then, the supported operational path is explicit retrieval and verification of canonical external state. This is an epistemic stop condition, not an implementation of automatic bootstrap and not a change to `OPTION_D=RATIFIED_NO_BOOTSTRAP` or any technical gate.

## 8. Scope and non-goals

This is a documentation/control-plane repair only. It does not create trust roots, keys, credentials, Entra registrations, authority assets, production providers, an MCP allowlist, protected reads, local runtime or tunnel. It does not change IABV technical acceptance criteria. G1/G2/G3 remain `NOT_ESTABLISHED` until their independent product evidence is supplied. No test suite or runtime was executed as part of this method authoring.
